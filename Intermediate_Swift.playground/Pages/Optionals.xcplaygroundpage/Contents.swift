/*:
 ### What are Optionals?
 - Optionals are used in situations where a value may be absent.
 - Eg. a Person class may have a LibraryCard property. Since some people don't have library cards we should model this as an optional.
 - Optionals have 2 possibilities: 1) there is a value and you can unwrap it to access the value, or 2) there isn't a value, it is `nil`, and unwrapping crashes the app.
 - In Swift you can only assign `nil` to a value that is marked as being an optional type.
 - So, if I plan on setting a variable to `nil` at any point in its life then it must be wrapped as an optional type.
 - One place this comes up often is in VC's when you have a property that doesn't have a value by initialization.

/*:
 ##### Unwrapping
 - Think of optionals as boxed objects (remember how you have to unwrap NSNumber to do math with it, you must unbox optionals to do stuff with them just the same).
 - If you force unwrap an optional that is `nil` Swift will crash.
 - There are numerous ways to unwrap optionals in Swift and how you do this is important to readability and good coding style:
 */
/*:
 ** Unwrapping Techniquest
 - Forced unwrapping.
 - `nil` checking with forced unwrapping.
 - Optional binding (with `if` and `guard`).
 - `nil` Coalescing.
 - Implicit unwrapping.
 - Optional Chaining.
 */

/*: -------------------- */
/*:
 ##### **Forced UnWrap**
 - Everyone knows about forced unwrap.
 - Use it when you **absolutely** expect a value to be there and the app cannot continue without the value.
 - Avoid using forced unwrap just because you don't understand what's happening.
 - Never force unwrap a value you didn't create, like data from a network request.
 */

//Eg. Forced Unwrap
let nummy = Int("12")
print(#line, nummy as Any) // notice this prints the int wrapped
nummy!

/*: -------------------- */
/*:
 ##### **`nil` checking with forced unwrap**
 - Generally avoid doing this.
 */

var dict1 = ["key1": 12]

// Note: Attempts to access a dictionary always return an optional
let val1 = dict1["key1"]

// never do this ‚ò†Ô∏è
if val1 != nil {
  let result = val1! + 10 // we must unwrap it to do stuff
  print(#line, result)
}

/*:
 ##### **Optional Binding (prefer this üòÄ) **
 - `if let/var`
 - `guard let/var`
 - Use them when a `nil` value is possible and prefer them over forced unwrapping and nil checking.
 - Use `guard let` if you want an early exit if a given value(s) is `nil`.

myCell?.textLabel?.text = "pick up fruit"
myCell?.textLabel?.text

//: I'm upcasting here (Look ma no _as_).
// Notice I don't need to do this:
// vanillaCell = myCell as UITableViewCell
// This is because the compiler knows that the type of MyCell is a subclass of UITableViewCell so it Is-A UITableViewCell. I explictly told it this by making MyCell a subclass of UITableViewCell.

vanillaCell = myCell

// print(#line, (vanillaCell?.textLabel?.text)!) // this is optional chaining, more on this below. For now notice that each element in this chain is an optional.

/*: -------------------- */

class Person3: Mammal {

}

class Dog: Mammal {}

//: Notice person is upcast to an AnyObject when I initialize it.

let person3: AnyObject = Person3()
if person3 is Mammal {
  print(#line, "Person is a mammal")
}

//: Because Person3 was cast to an AnyObject the compiler cannot infer its underlying type at compile time.
//: If we try to _downcast_ person3 to it's underlying type Person3 we can't just use _as_ since this cast could fail.
//: We must indicate that this cast could fail using either the "?" called an "optional downcast" or "!" which is an "forced downcast".
//: Like forced unwrappingm Swift will crash if you attempt to force downcast to the wrong type.
//: If you do an optional cast then you must still unwrap the result, but it prevents a crash if you make a mistake.

let optionalDownCastP3 = person3 as? Person3
let forcedDownCastP3 = person3 as! Mammal

/*:
 _Question:_
 * Should we use optional or forced downcast on our person3 instance?
 */

let p4 = person3 as? Dog
p4 //: p4 is _not_ of type Dog

// if we forced downcast this would crash
// let p44 = person3 as! Dog

/*: -------------------- */
/*:
 #### **Optional Chaining**
 - Is Shorthand for unwrapping optionals.
 - It overloads the `?`, which makes it a bit confusing.
 - The whole expression evalutes to an optional. So, you still have to unwrap the whole expression.
 - It allows a nested optional expression to fail anywhere along the unwrapping.
 - If it does fail to have a value anywhere along the expression the whole expression evaluates to an optional containing nil.
 - If each optional has a value then the whole expression evalutes to an optional containing a value.
 */

/*:
 #### **Optional Chaining**
 */

class LibraryCard2 {
  var borrowCount: Int = 0
}

class Citizen {
  // not every citize has a libraryCard
  internal var libraryCard: LibraryCard2?
  init(libraryCard: LibraryCard2?) {
    self.libraryCard = libraryCard
  }
}



let citizen = Citizen(libraryCard: nil)

//: If we wanted to access the borrowCount we could first unwrap the libraryCard and then access the borrowCount property if it's not nil like this:

if let libCard = citizen.libraryCard {
  print(#line, libCard.borrowCount)
}

//: Or we could use _Optional Chaining_ (preferred) like this:

let noCount = citizen.libraryCard?.borrowCount // borrowCount has become an optional because libraryCard is!

noCount // nil since citizen has no library card


//: üìù The `?` when added after a type means "this is an optional and the value could be absent/nil at some point, so wrap it in an optional".
//: Eg.

var myOpttt: String?
myOpttt = "assigned"

//: üìù The `?` when added after the cast declaration `as?` means "this cast might fail and hence evaluate to nil, so wrap it in an optional".

let baddd: AnyObject = MyCell()
let badddCast = baddd as? UITableView
badddCast

//: üìù The `?` when added after an init means "the returned object could be nil so wrap the return in an optional".

class MyObj {
  init?() {}
}

let myObj = MyObj()

//: üìù But the `?` when added after a property means something completely different.
//: * When added after an optional property `?` means "if it has a value access it, otherwise evaluate to nil and exit".
//: * Optional chaining can work on any number of optional properties (a chain).
//: * Optional chaining can fail anywhere along the chain if it encounters a nil.
//: * _Whether the chain has a value or doesn't, the expression is "unwound" and wrapped in an optional_.
//: * Think of it like "bubbling" any value up to the top level optional.
//: * You still need to unwrap the top level optional.

// We still have to unwrap it to do stuff with it (notice I'm binding to a var here to allow me to mutate it)
if var number = number {
