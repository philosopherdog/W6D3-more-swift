 ### **LightHouse: Intermediate Swift**
 
 - I'm experimenting using playgrounds
 - _Do:_ sections will allow us to practice as we go, time permitting
 - I also have _Do On Your Own_, which I recommend you work through if you need extra practice after lecture
 - To get the most out of them PLEASE AVOID COPY/PASTE
 - I've found _Manual Run_ least problematic for working with playgrounds
 - I recommend that you bind a hot key to _Execute Playground_
