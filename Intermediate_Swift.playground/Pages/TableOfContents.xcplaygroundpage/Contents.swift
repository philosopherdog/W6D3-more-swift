 ### **LightHouse: Intermediate Swift**
 
 - I'm experimenting using playgrounds
 - _Do:_ sections will allow us to practice as we go
 - Most of the _Do:'s_ are pretty basic
 - To get the most out of them PLEASE AVOID COPY/PASTE
 - Actually, _always_ avoid COPY/PASTE.
 - I've found _Manual Run_ least problematic for working with playgrounds
 - I recommend that you bind a hot key to _Execute Playground_
